# **PROJECT**  
## **Sentiment Analysis on Drug Reviews**  
This project is a comprehensive implementation of **Sentiment Analysis** applied to drug reviews, aiming to determine user sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).  
By leveraging a robust machine learning model, **LightGBM**, it efficiently classifies reviews while providing actionable insights into user satisfaction with various drugs.  

---

## **Overview**  
Understanding public sentiment toward drugs is critical for healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and policymakers.  
This project analyzes a large dataset of drug reviews to:  
- **Identify user sentiment trends**  
- Highlight the most common concerns or praises  
- Support decision-making in drug development, marketing, and patient care  

---

## **Key Features**  
### **1. Extensive Dataset**  
- The project utilizes a **Kaggle drug review dataset** with **161,218 reviews**.  
- Includes fields such as drug name, condition, rating, review text, and sentiment.  

### **2. Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline**  
- Handling missing values  
- Removing stopwords, special characters, and noise in text  
- Lemmatization to normalize text  
- Tokenization for machine learning compatibility  

### **3. State-of-the-Art Machine Learning Model**  
- Implemented **LightGBM**, a high-performance gradient boosting model  
- Optimized hyperparameters for faster training and higher accuracy  
- Supports **multiclass classification** for nuanced sentiment detection  

### **4. Interactive Analysis**  
- Extracts insights like **top positive and negative keywords**  
- Provides distribution graphs for sentiment trends across drugs and conditions  

### **5. Scalable Workflow**  
- Easily integrates additional data or features  
- Supports deployment for real-time sentiment analysis in healthcare systems

## **Technologies and Tools**  
### **Programming Language**  
- Python  

### **Libraries Used**  
- **LightGBM**: Model training and evaluation  
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: Data manipulation  
- **Scikit-learn**: Preprocessing and validation  
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: Data visualization  
- **NLTK** and **spaCy**: Text processing and tokenization  

### **Development Tools**  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for exploration and experimentation  
- **Git** for version control  

---

## **Project Goals**  
- Develop an efficient pipeline for sentiment analysis of drug reviews  
- Provide insights into patient feedback for improved healthcare outcomes  
- Create a scalable framework that can be applied to other sentiment analysis tasks
