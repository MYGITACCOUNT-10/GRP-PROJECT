# GRP-PROJECT

**Sentiment Analysis on Drug Reviews**\n
This project is a comprehensive implementation of Sentiment Analysis applied to drug reviews, aiming to determine user sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).
By leveraging a robust machine learning model, LightGBM, it efficiently classifies reviews while providing actionable insights into user satisfaction with various drugs.

**Overview**
Understanding public sentiment toward drugs is critical for healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical companies, and policymakers. 
This project analyzes a large dataset of drug reviews to:

**Identify user sentiment trends**
Highlight the most common concerns or praises.
Support decision-making in drug development, marketing, and patient care.
